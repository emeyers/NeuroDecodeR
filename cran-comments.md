## Resubmission 3

I noticed I was still getting errors that a couple of links were still not working. This is a resubmission prior to getting feedback on submission 2 in order to fix these broken links.


 * Removed the link to Travis CI since I am not longer using it and it was giving a 404. Changed the link to the PNAS article since it was giving a 503, to a link to a pubmed reference to the article.

Hopefully all the links are fixed now!

Regards,

Ethan




## Resubmission 2

Responding to feedback again from Uwe Ligges

 * There appeared to be 5 links in the documentation that while not broken, were being automatically forwarded to new links by the respective websites. These links have now been set to web addresses that they were being forwarded to. Hopefully this fixed there remaining issue.

Thanks again for reviewing my submission!

Regards,

Ethan
